Cloud consulting is a service provided to organizations by cloud professionals, where they design, implement, migrate, or maintain cloud applications, processes, or computing systems. The job duties often include software installation and hardware configuration as well as customization to fit the requirements of the company.
Roles and Responsibilities of Cloud Consultant
Who provides Cloud consulting services?
Initially, niche companies dominated the industry, but as large technical service firms and multinational systems integrators have acquired smaller cloud professionals to develop their own cloud consulting practices, the market has become more competitive. Top cloud platform providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, among others, are rolling out a growing number of cloud services. Cloud consultants have expanded their portfolios, for example, by reaching out into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. To make cloud adoption easier, consultants are specializing in vertical markets including financial services and healthcare. As Cloud platforms become more sophisticated, these patterns will continue.
